(These steps are not neccasary but are extremly recommended as they improve the python experence)

Github codespaces come with python 3.12.1 pre-installed, but for use to properly use it we need to do some things.
1. Install the python extensions in VS Code
click on the three squars in the left corner to open up the extensions tab, this is where you can see and install all of you extensions.
We are not going to install them this way but if you want to you can.

To insall the neccasary python extenshions start by clicking CRTL + SHIFT + E to open the explorer.
then click the little new file button and in the menu that pops up type "test.py" make sure the py part is there.
Then you will get a notification asking "Do you want to install the recommended python extensions", here you click install and wait for the extensions to install.

Now you can start writing your first python script
